Hi this is a Math Assistant 
 1.This project introduces a voice-activated AI assistant designed for visually
 impaired individuals to solve mathematical problems on computers. Activated by
 pressing the space bar on a PC or laptop, the assistant greets users and awaits spoken
 commands, eliminating the need for traditional  Braille inputs.
 The system converts spoken mathematical queries into text using advanced
 speech recognition. AI21 processes this text to generate precise solutions, which are
 communicated audibly through text-to-speech conversion, facilitating seamless
 interaction.
 2.Key components :include integration with pynput for keyboard input detection,
 pyttsx3 for text-to-speech synthesis, and speech_recognition for accurate speech-to-text
 conversion. 
 3.These technologies empower visually impaired users to independently
 access and solve mathematical problems. By focusing on mathematical problem-solving,
 the project enhances users' independence and computational abilities while promoting
 inclusivity in digital interactions. It represents a significant advancement in leveraging
 technology to bridge accessibility gaps, ensuring visually impaired individuals can
 effectively engage with computer-based mathematical applications and services.
 4. Visually Impaired User: This is the primary actor interacting with the system.
 Activate Assistant: The user activates the assistant by pressing the space bar
 ten times. This triggers the system to start listening for voice commands.
 5.Speak Command: The user then speaks a mathematical query or command.
 Recognize Speech: The system converts the spoken words into text using the
 speech recognition module.
 6.Process Command: The text is processed by the Natural Language Processing
 (NLP) module to understand the user's intent.
 7.Detect Key Presses: This module detects the specific key press pattern (ten
 space bar presses) to activate the assistant.
 8.Convert Speech to Text: This process involves converting the user's spoken
 words into text format.
 9.NLPAnalysis: The text is analyzed to determine the user's query or command.

Generate AI Response: The AI computation engine processes the query and
 generates a textual response.
 Text-to-Speech Conversion: The generated text response is converted into
 speech using the text-to-speech (TTS) module.
 Provide Audio Output: The system provides auditory feedback to the user,
 delivering the response in spoken form.
